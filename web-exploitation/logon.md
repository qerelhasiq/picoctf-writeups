## Problem Description
The factory is hiding information from its users. The objective is to log in as Joe and discover what restricted content they have been viewing.

---

## Approach
Analyze how the website handles authentication and authorization.
Even though login attempts always return a success message, access to the flag appears restricted.
Inspecting client-side storage reveals that access control is based on a cookie value, which can be manually modified.

---

## Solution Steps
1. Access the website.
2. Open Developer Tools or right-click and then Inspect Element.
3. Attempt to log in using any username and password.
4. The site responds with: “Success: You logged in! Not sure you'll be able to see the flag though. No flag for you.”
5. Navigate to the Application/Storage tab and select Cookies.
6. Locate the cookie named admin, which is set to False.
7. Modify the value to: True
8. Refresh the page.
9. The flag is now displayed.
