## Problem Description
Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one.

---

## Approach
Inspect and modify the browser’s stored cookies using Developer Tools.
Since the website relies on a cookie value to determine the selected option, changing this value manually may reveal hidden content. 
By incrementing the cookie value, the correct selection that exposes the flag can be found.

## Solution Steps
1. Access the website.
2. Open Developer Tools or right-click and Inspect Element.
3. Navigate to the Application/Storage tab and select Cookies.
4. Locate the cookie storing the selection value (initially set to -1).
5. Modify the value to another number and refresh the page.
6. Continue incrementing the value and refreshing until the correct value is found.
7. When the value is set to 18, refreshing the page reveals the flag.
