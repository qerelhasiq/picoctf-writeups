## Problem Description
A tip suggests that the website’s source code contains important information that requires inspection.
The goal is to carefully examine the website’s client-side files to uncover the hidden flag.

---

## Approach
Since the challenge name references “Inspect,” the flag is likely hidden within the webpage’s source files.
Examine all client-side components: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using Developer Tools to locate different parts of the flag.

## Solution Steps
1. Open the website in a browser.
2. Open Developer Tools or right-click and then Inspect Element.
3. In the Elements/Inspector tab, review the HTML source code.
4. The first part of the flag is found within the HTML.
5. Navigate to the Style Editor and open `mycss.css`.
6. The second part of the flag is located inside the CSS file.
7. Go to the Debugger tab and open `myjs.js`.
8. The final part of the flag is found in the JavaScript file.
9. Combine all parts to reconstruct the complete flag.
