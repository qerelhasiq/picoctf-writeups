## Problem Description
This challenge involves exploring a web application to discover an exposed endpoint that leaks sensitive information.
The site appears to be a simple blog platform (picoCTF News), but hidden within it is an endpoint that generates a server memory dump.
The goal is to locate this endpoint and extract the hidden flag from the exposed memory file.

---

## Approach
Enumerate accessible endpoints within the web application to identify unintended exposures.
The `/heapdump` endpoint reveals a memory snapshot of the running server process.
Since memory dumps may contain sensitive data in plaintext, extracting readable strings from the file can reveal the flag.

## Solution Steps

### Method 1: Direct Access via Browser
1. Append **/heapdump** to the website URL: `http://verbal-sleep.picoctf.net:50231/heapdump`
2. If accessible, the browser downloads a heap snapshot file.
3. Open the file using a text editor (e.g., VS Code or Notepad++).
4. Search for **picoCTF{** the flag appears in plaintext.

### Method 2: Using Kali Linux (CLI Method)
1. Download the heap dump using **curl**: `curl http://verbal-sleep.picoctf.net:50231/heapdump -o heapdump`
2. Extract readable strings: `strings heapdump`
3. Filter for the flag: `strings heapdump | grep "picoCTF{"`
