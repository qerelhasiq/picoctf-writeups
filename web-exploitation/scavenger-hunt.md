## Problem Description
The website appears simple at first glance, but hints suggest that important information is hidden throughout different parts of the site.
The objective is to thoroughly explore the web application and uncover all pieces of the hidden flag.

---

## Approach
Systematically inspect all client-side resources and publicly accessible files.
Since this is a scavenger hunt, the flag is split into multiple parts hidden across HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and common server configuration files.

---

## Solution Steps
1. Access the website by entering the URL in the browser.
2. Open Developer Tools or right-click and Inspect Element.
3. Under the Elements/Inspector tab, the first part of the flag is found within the HTML source.
4. A comment mentions that the website uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
5. Navigate to the Style Editor and open `mycss.css`.
6. The second part of the flag is located around `line 51`.
7. Open the Debugger tab and inspect `myjs.js`.
   - A hint is found: “How can I keep Google from indexing my website?”
9. To prevent search engines from indexing a site, a `robots.txt` file is used.
   - Access it by visiting: `/robots.txt` or `http://wily-courier.picoctf.net:52634/robots.txt`
11. The third part of the flag is found there.
    - The file also mentions that the server is running Apache.
13. Since Apache is used, check common Apache configuration files such as: `/.htaccess`, meaning `http://wily-courier.picoctf.net:52634/.htaccess`
14. Accessing this file reveals the fourth part of the flag.
    - A clue suggests that information is stored on a Mac.
16. macOS systems commonly generate `.DS_Store` files.
    - Access: `/.DS_Store` through `http://wily-courier.picoctf.net:52634/.DS_Store`
18. The fifth and final part of the flag is found here.
19. Combine all five parts to reconstruct the complete flag.
