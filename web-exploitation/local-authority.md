## Problem Description
The website presents a 'Secure Customer Portal' that only allows alphanumeric usernames and passwords.
The objective is to bypass the login mechanism and obtain the hidden flag.

---

## Approach
Analyze the login process using the browser’s Developer Tools.
By inspecting network traffic and client-side JavaScript files, sensitive information such as hardcoded credentials can be discovered.

---

## Solution Steps
1. Access the website.
2. Open Developer Tools (Inspect Element).
3. Attempt to log in using any random username and password.
4. Observe activity in the _Network_ or _Debugger_ tab and identify any JavaScript files being loaded.
5. Locate and open the JavaScript file (**secure.js**).
6. Review the source code, the valid credentials are hardcoded: `( username === 'admin' && password === 'strongPassword098765' )`
7. Log in using these credentials to access the portal and retrieve the flag.
