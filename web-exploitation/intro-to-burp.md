## Problem Description
A registration website is provided with five input fields and a Register button.
After submission, an OTP verification step appears. The objective is to bypass the OTP mechanism and retrieve the flag.

---

## Approach
Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify HTTP requests. Analyze how the OTP parameter is handled and manipulate the request to bypass validation.

---

## Solution Steps
1. Launch Burp Suite.
2. Navigate to Proxy and then Intercept.
3. Click Open the browser and access: `http://titan.picoctf.net:53024/`
4. Fill in the registration form with dummy data and click Register.
5. An OTP verification page appears. Testing random values, ranging from numbers to text, all return “Invalid OTP” responses, indicating improper validation and sanitization of the otp parameter.
6. With Intercept ON, submit the OTP request again.
7. In the intercepted request at the bottom left of the screen, locate the parameter: `otp=<value>`
8. Remove the entire otp parameter (or its value).
9. Forward the modified request.
10. The server processes the request without OTP validation and returns the flag in the browser
