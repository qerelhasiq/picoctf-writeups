## Problem Description
A registration website is provided with five input fields and a Register button.
After submission, an OTP verification step appears. The objective is to bypass the OTP mechanism and retrieve the flag.

---

## Approach
Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify HTTP requests. Analyze how the OTP parameter is handled and manipulate the request to bypass validation.

---

## Solution Steps
1. Launch Burp Suite.
2. Go to Proxy then Intercept.
3. Click Open Browser and enter the website: `http://titan.picoctf.net:53024/`
4. Fill in all the details with dummy data and click Register.
5. An OTP section appears. Trying random values, from numbers to text, all return “Invalid OTP” responses, indicating that the OTP is not validated and sanitized properly.
6. Toggle Intercept ON, then click Register again.
7. In the intercepted request (bottom left under Request), locate the `otp=` section.
8. Simply remove `otp=<value>`.
9. Forward the request, and the flag will be given in the browser.
