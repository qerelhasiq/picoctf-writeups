## Problem Description
The challenge hints that something related to “robots” is hidden on the website. The goal is to locate and access it.

2. Append `/robots.txt` to the end of the website URL: `http://example.com/robots.txt`
3. Identify the directory listed under: `Disallow:`
4. Copy the disallowed path and append it to the base URL.
