## Problem Description
A person of interest is suspected of hiding sensitive data behind a restricted web portal. The email used to log in is known: _ctf-player@picoctf.org_, but the password is unknown and brute-force attempts are ineffective. However, hints suggest that a developer may have left a hidden access method. The goal is to uncover and exploit this weakness to log in.

## Approach
Inspect the website’s HTML and client-side resources for comments or clues that reveal unintended functionality or developer backdoors.

## Solution Steps
1. Open the website and enter Developer Tools (Inspect Element).
2. Review the HTML source and comments.
3. An encrypted comment is found: `ABGR: Wnpx - grzcbenel olcnff: hfr urnqre "K-Qri-Npprff: lrf"`
   - Alongside a warning comment: `“Remove before pushing to production!”`
5. The encryption used is ROT13. Decoding it (e.g., using CyberChef) reveals: `NOTE: Jack - temporary bypass: use header "X-Dev-Access: yes"`
6. This indicates a developer backdoor that bypasses authentication when a specific HTTP header is included.
7. Open the Network tab in Developer Tools and attempt a login with dummy credentials to identify the endpoint. The request is sent to /login.
8. Use curl to manually send a POST request with the required header: `curl -X POST -H "X-Dev-Access: yes" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"ctf-player@picoctf.org"}' http://amiable-citadel.picoctf.net:50597/login`
9. The password field is not required because the `X-Dev-Access` header bypasses authentication.
10. The server responds with the password, which can then be used to obtain the flag.
