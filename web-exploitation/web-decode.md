## Problem Description
The challenge hints that the flag is hidden within the webpage and can be discovered through browser inspection tools.

---

## Approach
The flag is hidden client-side. Inspect pages and HTML elements for hidden or encoded strings that can be decoded to reveal the flag.

---

## Solution Steps
1. Open the website and navigate through all available pages.
2. On the About page, inspect the HTML using Developer Tools.
3. Noticed a weird-looking string: `notify_true=<Base64_string>`
4. Open the Console tab and decode the string using: `atob("<Base64_string>")`
5. The decoded output reveals the flag.
