## Challenge Information
- **Name:** WebDecode
- **Author:** Nana Ama Atombo-Sackey
- **Category:** Web Exploitation
- **Difficulty:** Easy

---

## Problem Description
The challenge hints that the flag is hidden within the webpage and can be discovered through browser inspection tools.

---

## Approach
Since the description explicitly references the **web inspector**, the focus shifts to client-side analysis rather than server-side exploitation.

Steps taken:
- Navigate through all accessible pages.
- Inspect page source and HTML elements.
- Look for hidden strings, comments, or encoded values.

While browsing the **About** page, a message suggests inspecting the page more closely.<br>
Examining the HTML reveals a suspicious string: `notify_true=<long_encoded_string>`<br>
The structure and character pattern resemble Base64 encoding, which is commonly used in beginner CTF challenges.

---

## Solution Steps
1. Open the website and navigate through all available pages.
2. On the About page, inspect the HTML using Developer Tools (F12 → Elements tab).
3. Noticed a weird-looking string: `notify_true=<Base64_string>`
4. Open the Console tab and decode the string using: `atob("<Base64_string>")`
5. The decoded output reveals the flag.
