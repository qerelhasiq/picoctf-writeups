## Problem Description
The Cookie Monster has hidden his top-secret cookie recipe on the website.
The goal is to retrieve the hidden recipe (the flag) by examining the client-side components, bypassing authentication if necessary.

---

## Approach
The website presents a login form, but valid credentials are unknown.
Testing arbitrary credentials does not grant access, suggesting the flag may be exposed on the client-side.

Initial analysis focuses on:
- JavaScript files
- Cookies
- Local/session storage

A cookie named `secret_recipe` is found, containing an encoded value.

---

## Solution Steps
- Insert dummy data for username and password

### Method 1: Inspect Cookies
- Open Developer Tools then Console.
- Retrieve the cookie: `document.cookie`
- Output example: `secret_recipe=cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzX0E2RkEwN0Q4fQ%3D%3D`
- Decode URL encoding: `decodeURIComponent("cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzX0E2RkEwN0Q4fQ%3D%3D")`
- Decode Base64: `atob("cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzX0E2RkEwN0Q4fQ==")`
- Or One-liner alternative: `atob(decodeURIComponent(document.cookie.split("=")[1]))`
- Flag given

### Method 2: Using External Tools
- Navigate to Developer Tools then Storage and lastly Cookies.
- Copy the value of secret_recipe.
- Decode in terminal (e.g., Kali Linux): `echo "<cookie_value>" | base64 -d`
- Flag is output directly.
