## Problem Description
A “secure” portal is provided that requires a password to gain access.
The challenge hints that security mechanisms implemented on the client side may be flawed.
The objective is to analyze how the password validation works and bypass the protection.

---

## Approach
Inspect the website’s client-side JavaScript code.
Since the challenge name suggests avoiding client-side validation, the password verification logic is likely implemented in JavaScript.
By analyzing the verification function, the correct password can be reconstructed.

## Solution Steps
1. Access the website.
2. Open Developer Tools or right-click and then Inspect.
3. Navigate to the Debugger tab and open the main JavaScript file labeled (index).
4. Locate the verify() function responsible for password validation.
5. Observe that the password is checked in segments (split into 4-character parts).
6. Extract each segment in the order they are validated.
7. Reconstruct the full password by combining the segments in ascending order.
8. The reconstructed password is the flag.
