## Problem Description
How well can you perfom basic binary operations?

---

## Approach
AND (&) = When both inputs are 1, output is 1
OR (|) = When either input is 1, output is 1
NOT (!) = When input is 0, output is 1 and vice versa
LEFT SHIFT (<<) = Add a 0 at the end of the binary
RIGHT SHIFT (>>) = Add a 0 at the start of the binary, remove the last bit of the binary
ADD (+) = 0 added to 0 is 0, 0 added to 1 is 1, and 1 added to 1 is 10 
MULTIPLICATION (*) = Convert both binaries to decimal, then convert back to decimal

## Solution Steps
1. Apply the appropriate binary operation based on the question.
2. Perform bitwise or arithmetic calculations using binary rules.
3. Verify the result by converting to decimal when necessary.
4. Enter the computed binary value as the final answer.
